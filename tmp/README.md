# /tmp Usage

This directory should be used for local development only. Everything in /tmp
is ignored (with the exception of this README) by the .gitignore file.

**IMPORTANT**: that does mean that nothing in /tmp will be backed up on
github, so make sure that if you put anything in here that you want to keep
when your computer dies, you back it up somewhere else.
